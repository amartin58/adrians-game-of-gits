House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Unfortunately, "Ned" was conquered by an invading enemy and was defeated. There is now a new Lord of Winterfell.
